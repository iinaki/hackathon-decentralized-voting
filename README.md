# DVOTE

The voting process in general elections is fraught with several critical challenges that undermine the integrity, transparency, and efficiency of the electoral system. These challenges include election fraud, lack of transparency, limited accessibility, inefficiency, and concerns about security and privacy. To address these issues, DVote, a decentralized voting application, leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, efficient, and accessible voting system. For voters, DVote is incredibly user-friendly. The process of casting a vote is straightforward and intuitive, ensuring that even those with limited technological skills can participate with ease. Voters simply need to access the application, verify their identity using their ID and cast their vote securely and anonymously. It works by hashing the voters ID before sending the transaction in the blockchain with the users election choices, so that the register that is displayed in the blockchain does not show any personal information abaout the voter.

### How to run the app
1. Edit the contracts address in 'src/config.json'
2. Run in the terminal:
```
npm install
```
